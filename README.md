# PythonTutorials
These are Python tutorials that I prepared for my students enrolled in Math 195- Math Methods for Social Sciences 1 and Math 196 - Linear Algebra courses at the University of Chicago. 

I recently updated some of these for my students in Math 211 - Basics of Numerical Analysis course.

I very much appreciate your comments and feedbacks.
