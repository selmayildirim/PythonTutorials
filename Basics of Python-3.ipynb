    "# Basics of Python - Part 3 - Conditionals and Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will look at the conditionals and for and while loops briefly. Why conditionals? Conditional statements are boolen statements helping us to check some given conditions and act accordingly. For example, we tell the computer do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "If this statement is true, then perform b.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, for and while statements helps us to do the repetitive statements in an efficient way. If we want to do the same repetitive task over and over by using values similar to each other, we could use a for (or while) statement instead of typinng the same thing over an over. By doing this, we write a more clean, neat code while saving a lot of time.\n",

    "## If statements\n",
    "\n",
    "If statements are used to check conditional arguments. Checking a condition means using comparison operators to find out if the statement is True or False. So, we use ==, !=, <, <=, > and >= to check whether a statement is True or False (Please refer to Part 1 for the comparison operators). \n",
    "\n",
    "* If we are checking several conditions at the same time, we use if, elif and else as follows. (If we already used one if statement, the second condition must be written with elif (shortcut for else if)) \n",
    "\n",
    "* Here is how an if statement works: Computer checks the first condition; if it is True, it will give you that output. If not True, it goes to the second condition. If the second one is True, that will produce the output. If that is also not True, it will check the next statement and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We write the last statement with else. This is optional. Note that else statement doesn't have any conditional argument. This means if all other conditions are not satisfied, this is what you want your computer to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Indentation is very important when writing these statements. It is 4 spaces from left. Also, don't forget semicolon : at the end of each statement. Otherwise, it will give a SyntaxError.\n",
