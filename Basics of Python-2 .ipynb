    "Lists are included in Sequence Types in Python and they are mutable. Lists are one of my favorite objects in Python; I use them a lot to solve many mathematical problems, as we will see in an example below. We create lists with square brackets, [ ]. Lists are mutable, ordered objects. Ordered means they store elements in an ordered way (i.e., each element has a position) and you can look at the specific range of elements in a set if you like. I should also mention that in Python, the indexing start from 0 meaning that the position of the first item is always 0. \n",
